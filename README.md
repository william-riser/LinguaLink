# LinguaLink
LinguaLink is a language learning platform the allows users to connect from all over the world and converse with each other via text and video call. It also gives users the option to sharpen their skills via AI chat.
## How to Use
### Video and Text Chat
After choosing a langauge on the home page and selecting chat with people, uers will be places in a room with another person who chose the same language. They will first talk through the text chat and after confirmation from both parties one user will create the call and send the code via chat and start the video call. The video call starts after users turn on their webcam and the person who didn't create the call answers with the call ID. This method prevents users from entering into video calls with people they arent' comfortable with and adds an extra layer of security for our users.
### AI Chat 
After choosing a langauge on the home page and selecting chat with AI, users will have a texting interface in which they can converse with the AI in their language of choice in either english or non-english characters. This feature allows those who aren't comfortable witht talking with real people to talk with an AI and experience the same benefits.
